  desc: "Color (American English), or colour (Commonwealth English), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc."

    several times burgomaster of Antwerp, and one of the most

    his outstanding draughtsmanship and attention to detail. Yet on

    themselves to be crudely painted, to our minds unable to bear
    comparison with undisputed works of his from any period.'
