- title: 'Eyewitnesses'
  desc: 'In looking at the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah we are
    particularly fortunate to have the visual testimony of two
    eyewitnesses. Two artists, both contemporaries of Rubens and the
    painting’s owner Nicholas Rockox, made separate copies of Rubens’
    original painting early in the 17th century. Their copies survive
    to this day, and agree on major points of composition which are
    strikingly different to that of the painting hanging in the
    National Gallery. No reasonable explanation for this has ever been
    given.'
- title: 'Provenance'
  desc: 'The Samson and Delilah’s provenance – its whereabouts over the
    years – is complex and uncertain. In reality, there are only two
    things of which we can be absolutely certain. The first is that
    Rubens painted a Samson and Delilah in the year or so after his
    return from Italy at the end of 1608. It hung in the house of his
    friend and patron Nicolaas Rockox, several times burgomaster of
    Antwerp, and one of the most cultured and influential figures in
    the city. The painting is mentioned in an inventory, and as we
    have seen in the The Eyewitnesses, was recorded by 2 artists while
    Rubens and Rockox still lived. The year following Rockox’s death
    in 1640, the painting was auctioned off along with the rest of his
    property for the benefit of the poor. Now while there are various
    isolated references to similar sounding paintings later in the 17
    th century, this is the last cast-iron reference to Rubens’
    original Samson and Delilah. The second certain fact is that the
    painting that hangs in the National Gallery today (whether or not
    you believe it to be the same painting that disappeared in 1641)
    was discovered by the art dealer Curt Benedict in the hands of a
    restorer in Paris in 1929, and was at first attributed to the 17th
    century Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst.'
